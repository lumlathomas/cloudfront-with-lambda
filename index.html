    <h1>Welcome to my sample static website created with S3 bucket and CloudFront.</h1>
    <h2>Automation using Lambda function!</h2>
    <h3>What is invlaidation in CloudFront?</h3>
    <p>Invalidation refreshes the cache across all AWS edge locations (400+) whenever new updates are made to the live static website. 
      This ensures that the latest version of the website or pages is displayed once the invalidation is applied. </p>
